  <p align=center> I was dashing around the office. Everyone looked at me weird. I was screaming, "SUS! SUS! AMOGUS!"<br> Everyone started chanting with me. "SUS! SUS! AMOGUS! AMONG SUS! WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS!" We all did the Among Us beatbox in unison. It was beautiful.<br> Like a horse waving its mane in the air on a bright and pretty day. But suddenly I noticed; one of the kids wasn't doing the Among Drip beatbox!<br> So I ran over to her.

"Hey kid," I said, "Stop being an asparagus or whatever your dumb star signs are and be not sussy with us!"<br> She looked at me weird and said "Whatever, old man." That was so disrespectful and SUS of her! So I put my hands around her neck and twisted her head off<br> "Like in that one kill animation in Among Us."

Everyone looked at me in horror, even the ones who were Among Beatboxing with me!<br> Everyone was looking at me like I had just sexually abused a Syrian 4 year old refugee (which I had done before.) I said "What?"<br> when suddenly the elevator opened. It was the CEO of Pepsi-co! I noticed the Pepsi pin on her shirt and said "When the Pepsi is sus!"<br> because it reminded me of the Among Us crewmate .I did the sussy Among Us beatbox. You know the one? <br>It goes; ding ding ding ding ding ding ding, ding ding ding! BM BM! You know the one!<br>

But, before I could finish it, I noticed; her boobs were big! I took my finger and poked her titty that was almost bursting out of her shirt.<br> "Booba." I said. She had a face more horrified than anyone in the room, like before when everyone looked at me last week like I murdered Bosnian children. <br>You remember that, right? She screamed "SECURITY!"

Two buff men with pecs almost as big as hers<br> and clothes so tight you could see their 12-pack abs through the shirt tackled me. I said "That's a bit SUSSY!"<br> (Like how the guy said it in the "STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONG US" rant. "You're not wholesome Keanu Chungus 100 Fortnite bad TikTok cringe Minecraft & Reddit good."<br> I said. I got out and kicked their nuts. Although they were big, (not as big as my magnum mega-cock, you know like the size of Danny Devito's?)<br> they still cried when I kicked their nuts.

"You fucking cracker-jacks! You're Tik-Tokers trying to invade Reddit!" I screamed.<br> I dashed for the door but an alarm started blaring and steel barriers went down over the windows.<br> I barely slid out of the door before the steel door closed under me. I heard the alarms blaring even from inside.<br> I started running, running away trying to flee the scene. Not even half a mile away I saw a SWAT police car dash by me.

It started to slow down, oh shit, they noticed me! I jumped into a nearby bush and hid, hoping he wouldn't see me.<br> Quickly, a bunch of men fully armed with automatic rifles and heavy armor came out of the back, scoping the area around.

"We can't let him get away!" I heard one of them yell. Were they talking about me?<br> I didn't do anything sus, at least if murder, sexual harassment, and assault don't count as being sus. I stayed still, not even making a sound.<br>

A few minutes in, I heard my dickhole queef. It didn't make that much of a sound but I just barely saw out of the bush, the SWAT team start looking around. Shit. They heard my cock fart.<br> I couldn't move as it would make too much noise. Eventually, after a while of looking, they just left. I was free. I quickly got out and ran, but making sure to run behind the bushes so I wouldn't be spotted.<br>

I eventually got into the main part of the city. The town wasn't all that big, but it was big enough for me to hide. I did it. I really did it. I had gotten away.<br>

Eventually, I made it far. Far out of town. I can't even tell Reddit where I am. It's too secret. I'm currently living a secret life in my inconspicuous location. But, this is the story of how I trolled my office. With Among Us.
